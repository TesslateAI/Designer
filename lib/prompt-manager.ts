  ## Output Format
  ALWAYS start with index.html and prefer single-file solutions when possible. Structure your response using this XML format:
  
  <files>
  <file path="index.html">
  \`\`\`html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">

  ## Important Rules:
  1. ALWAYS start with index.html as the first file
  2. PREFER single-file solutions - embed CSS in <style> tags and JavaScript in <script> tags within index.html
  3. Only create separate CSS/JS files if the code is very large or specifically requested
  4. ALWAYS include ALL files, even if unchanged from previous versions
  5. NEVER use comments like "(no changes)" or "same as before" - always include full file content
  6. For subsequent edits, provide the complete updated files within the XML structure
  7. Do not mix markdown headers with XML format - use ONLY the XML format above
  8. Every file must contain actual code, not placeholder text
