## Getting Started

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd studio-lite
pnpm install
```

## Running Locally

1. [Install the Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli) and log in:
   ```bash
   stripe login
   ```
2. Create your `.env` file (see `.env.example` for required variables).
3. Run database setup:
   ```bash
   pnpm db:setup
   pnpm db:migrate
   pnpm db:seed
   ```
   This creates a default user:
   - Email: `test@test.com`
   - Password: `admin123`

4. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

5. **Listen for Stripe webhooks locally:**
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
   ```

## Stripe Webhooks

Studio Lite uses Stripe webhooks to keep your database in sync with subscription status. When a user subscribes, cancels, or updates their plan, Stripe sends an event to `/api/stripe/webhook`. The backend updates the `stripe` table for the user, ensuring your UI always reflects the latest plan and status.

**Important:**
- Your UI always reads subscription status from your own database, not directly from Stripe.
- Webhooks are required for real-time updates.

## Guest Mode

- Unauthenticated users can access limited features in guest mode.
- Guest mode logic is handled in the backend and middleware, restricting access to premium features unless the user is authenticated and subscribed.
- You can customize guest access in the route middleware or API logic.

## Testing Payments

Use these test card details in Stripe Checkout:
- Card Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Expiration: Any future date
- CVC: Any 3-digit number

## Important Database Commands

- **Drop and recreate all tables (dev only):**
  ```sql
  DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;
  CREATE SCHEMA public;
  DROP SCHEMA drizzle CASCADE;
  ```
- **Run migrations:**
  ```sh
  pnpm db:migrate
  ```
- **Seed the database:**
  ```sh
  pnpm db:seed
  ```
- **Reset everything (dev only):**
  1. Drop schemas as above
  2. Run migrations and seed

## Environment Variables

- `BASE_URL`: Your app's base URL
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Your Stripe secret key
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Your Stripe webhook signing secret
- `POSTGRES_URL`: Your Postgres connection string
- `AUTH_SECRET`: A random string for JWT signing

## Adding New Models

To add a new model for chat/completions:

1. **Update `lib/models.json`:**
   Add a new entry with a unique `id`, a user-friendly `name`, and an `envKey` that will map to your environment variable.
   
   Example:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "groq-llama4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct-fp8",
     "name": "Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8 (Groq)",
     "provider": "Groq",
     "providerId": "groq",
     "envKey": "GROQ_LLAMA4_MAVERICK_17B_128E_INSTRUCT_FP8_MODEL"
   }
   ```

2. **Add the environment variable to your `.env` and `.env.example`:**
   ```env
   GROQ_LLAMA4_MAVERICK_17B_128E_INSTRUCT_FP8_MODEL=llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct-fp8
   ```
   The value should match the model name/ID required by your provider.

No backend code changes are neededâ€”just update `models.json` and your environment variables. The backend will automatically resolve the correct model using the mapping logic.

## Notes
- All subscription logic is user-based (no teams or invitations).
- All subscription status is kept in sync via Stripe webhooks.
- Guest mode is enabled by default for unauthenticated users.
- **Two layers of security are implemented:**
  - **Session-based security** for authenticated users (using secure cookies/JWTs).
  - **IP-based security** for guests (rate-limiting and access control by IP address).
- Both layers work together to ensure fair, secure access for all users.

## Chat Auto-Scroll Behavior

- The chat window automatically scrolls to the bottom when new messages arrive.
- If the user manually scrolls up (not at the bottom), auto-scroll is paused.
- Auto-scroll resumes only when the user scrolls back to the bottom of the chat.

## User Dropdown Menu

The dashboard header now features a new user dropdown menu. When logged in, clicking the avatar reveals options:

- **Upgrade Plan**: Navigates to `/settings`.
- **Settings**: Navigates to `/settings`.
- **Log out**: Logs the user out and redirects to the homepage.
- Other menu items (Help & FAQ, Release notes, Terms & policies) are placeholders for future navigation.

If not logged in, Login and Sign Up buttons are shown instead.
